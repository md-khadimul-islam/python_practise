# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.


# --------------------------------------- LOVE CALCULATOR -----------------------------------------------

u = name.count("u")

    print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
